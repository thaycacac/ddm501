# Tutorial 04 — Prometheus and Grafana

**DDM501 — AI in DevOps, DataOps, MLOps · FSB, FPT University**


## What this tutorial is for

The lab hands you finished dashboards and alert rules and has you fill in the instrumentation. Here you start from a service with **no metrics at all** and add them one at a time, asking each time what question the new metric answers.

## Setup

**With Docker** — needed for Prometheus and Grafana

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The model is trained *inside* the image build
Re-training means re-building — correct, because the model is a build artefact,
and it also guarantees the pickle matches the scikit-learn version in the image.

**Without Docker**  

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/train_model.py          # once
uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000
```

| | URL | Note |
|---|---|---|
| API | <http://127.0.0.1:18000/docs> | 8000 without Docker |
| Prometheus | <http://127.0.0.1:19090> | Status → Targets shows `wdbc-api` UP; compose waits for the API to be *healthy* before starting Prometheus, so it should be UP on the first look |
| Grafana | <http://127.0.0.1:13000> | anonymous viewer, dashboard `DDM501 / WDBC API` |

## Making something to look at

569 rows in a file draw no graphs. Leave this running in its own terminal:

```bash
python scripts/traffic.py --rps 20 --seconds 300
python scripts/traffic.py --broken 0.2        # 20% malformed requests
python scripts/traffic.py --drift 3.0         # shift every input by 3 sigma
```

## The exercises

| | Do this | Look for |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `curl localhost:8000/metrics` | The whole contract with Prometheus, in plain text. Read it once. |
| 2 | Traffic, then `python scripts/count_series.py` | 23 time series. Remember the number. |
| 3 | `python scripts/traffic.py --broken 0.2` | `wdbc_errors_total{reason="missing_features"}` climbs; the error-share panel moves. |
| 4 | `python scripts/traffic.py --drift 3.0` | Latency unchanged, error rate unchanged, `wdbc_malignant_share` moves a long way. Nothing is broken and the answers changed. |
| 5 | Restart with `T04_TRAP=1`, send traffic, run `count_series.py` again | 639 series instead of 23, for the same requests. |

## Checklist

1. Why is a Counter almost never read directly, and what do you wrap it in?
2. Your average latency is 40 ms. Name two very different situations that both
   produce that number, and say which metric type tells them apart.
3. `wdbc_model_info` is a gauge permanently stuck at 1. What is it for?
4. Every alert in `monitoring/prometheus/alerts/model.yml` has a `for:` clause.
   What breaks if you remove them?
5. The trap in exercise 5 turned 23 series into 639. What was the label, and
   why is the number unbounded rather than merely large?
6. During the `--drift 3.0` run, which of the four dashboard panels moved and
   which did not? What kind of failure is that, and would a normal web-service
   alert have caught it?
